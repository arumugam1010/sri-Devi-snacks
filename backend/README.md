## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- PostgreSQL (v13 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Copy the environment file and configure your database:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Update `.env` with your configuration:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/billing_system"

# JWT
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key-here"
JWT_EXPIRES_IN="24h"

# Server
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development

# CORS
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:5173"
```

### 3. Database Setup

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npm run db:generate

# Push schema to database (for development)
npm run db:push

# OR run migrations (for production)
npm run db:migrate

# Seed the database with sample data
npm run db:seed
```

### 4. Development

```bash
# Start development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

### 5. Database Management

```bash
# Open Prisma Studio (database GUI)
npm run db:studio

# Reset database
npx prisma migrate reset

# Generate new migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name your_migration_name
```

## Database Schema

The database includes the following main entities:

- **Users**: System users with role-based access
- **Shops**: Customer shops with contact information
- **Products**: Product catalog with HSN codes and GST
- **ShopProducts**: Shop-specific product pricing
- **Stock**: Inventory management
- **Bills**: Invoice generation with line items
- **BillItems**: Individual items in bills
- **Schedules**: Weekly delivery schedules

## Authentication

The API uses JWT tokens for authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```

### Default Users (after seeding)

- **Admin**: admin@billing.com / admin123
- **User**: user@billing.com / user123

## API Response Format

### Success Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Operation successful",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

### Error Response
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error description",
  "error": "Detailed error info"
}
```

### Paginated Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 10,
    "total": 100,
    "totalPages": 10,
    "hasNext": true,
    "hasPrev": false
  }
}
```

## Development Notes

### Database Relationships
- Users can create multiple bills
- Shops can have multiple products with different pricing
- Products can be in stock and sold across multiple bills
- Schedules define which shops are visited on which days
- Bills automatically update stock quantities

### Security Features
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token authentication
- Input validation with Zod
- SQL injection prevention with Prisma
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting ready (can be added)

### Performance Considerations
- Database indexing on frequently queried fields
- Pagination for large datasets
- Efficient joins with Prisma include
- Transaction support for data consistency

## Production Deployment

1. Set `NODE_ENV=production`
2. Use a proper PostgreSQL database
3. Configure secure JWT secret
4. Enable SSL for database connections
5. Set up proper logging
6. Configure reverse proxy (nginx)
7. Set up monitoring and error tracking
